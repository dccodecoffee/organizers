# Event Sponsor Email 

Hello! 

Thanks for your interest in becoming a sponsor of DC Code and Coffee!

As a sponsor of Code and Coffee:

- Your organization is featured in the name of the Meetup
- You’ll get a special shout-out during our standup at the event, and an opportunity to give a short description of your organization
- You’re welcome to share any job openings you may have during the jobs section of the standup
- You can leave out fliers or other information you’d like our attendees to have
- You’ll receive a shout-out during our promotion of the event on social media

Each new venue draws a slightly different crowd — but we typically draw between 30 and 70 folks of varying experience levels, from a wide variety of backgrounds from academics, government, project management, startups, bootcamp graduates, doctors, lawyers, and the occasional high school student (woohoo!). 

In return, we ask that you: 

- Make available your office space from 12:30pm to 5pm on select Sundays (event will run from 1:00pm to 4:30pm, and our organizer team will assist as appropriate in setup and cleanup before and after).
- Provide coffee for attendees (the coffee part of code and coffee!).
- Provide a circular carbohydrate as a snack (other venues have provided bagels or cupcakes).

Let me know how this sounds — and thanks for considering it!

If this sounds like something that your organization would be interested in, we can discuss specific dates for scheduling a DC Code and Coffee.

Thanks!
